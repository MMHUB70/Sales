Using HDInsight and Hive the following transformations were performed.

1)	
	a) Created a new table for your analysis call “sales_genre”.  
	b) Loaded the table “sales” into this table.
	c) Selected these only these columns: Genre, Global_Sales, Critic_Score.  
 
2) Rounded the data found in the “Global_Sales” column.  

3) Filtered the data to only look at those items in the “Critic_Score” column that are greater than 0.

4) Ordered the data in the “Critic_Score” column from highest to lowest.
